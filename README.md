# Machine Learning Tutorials - Part 5: Clustering

Welcome to **Machine Learning Tutorials - Part 5: Clustering**, where we explore unsupervised learning techniques to group data into clusters. This tutorial covers popular clustering algorithms such as **KMeans**, **Hierarchical Clustering**, and **DBSCAN**. Additionally, methods to evaluate the performance of these clustering algorithms are introduced using metrics like **Silhouette Score**, **Calinski-Harabasz Score**, **Davies-Bouldin Score**, and **Adjusted Rand Index**. We also use **Plotly** for 3D visualizations of clusters and **Yellowbrick**'s **KElbowVisualizer** to help determine the optimal number of clusters.

## Introduction
In this part, we focus on unsupervised learning, specifically clustering techniques:
- **KMeans**: A partition-based method that divides data into k clusters based on the distance between points and cluster centroids. We use **Yellowbrick's KElbowVisualizer** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a hierarchy of clusters by either merging or splitting clusters based on distance.
- **DBSCAN**: A density-based algorithm that groups points into clusters based on the density of nearby points.

We will also visualize the clusters using **Plotly** for interactive 3D plots, making it easier to understand how data points are grouped in a higher-dimensional space.

Additionally, we cover key metrics for evaluating clustering performance:
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar a point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
- **Calinski-Harabasz Score**: A ratio of the sum of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion.
- **Davies-Bouldin Score**: Measures the average similarity ratio between clusters.
- **Adjusted Rand Index**: Evaluates how well clusters match the true labels, accounting for random chance.

## Getting Started
Each algorithm, evaluation method, and visualization technique is explained in its own Jupyter Notebook file. To explore the tutorials, run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal and navigate to the `.ipynb` file for each topic to get hands-on practice with clustering, evaluation metrics, and 3D visualizations using **Plotly** and **Yellowbrick**.
